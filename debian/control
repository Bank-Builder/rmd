Description: Safe rm wrapper with trash integration
 A lightweight bash script that wraps the rm command with safety features:
  - Prevents deletion of system files
  - Warns about deleting folders and config files
  - Moves files to GNOME trash instead of permanent deletion
  - Provides Y/n/D prompt options
 .
 This tool helps prevent accidental data loss by moving deleted files
 to the trash instead of permanently removing them.
